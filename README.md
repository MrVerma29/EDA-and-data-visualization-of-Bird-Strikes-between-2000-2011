# EDA-and-data-visualization-of-Bird-Strikes-between-2000-2011

Transport and communication, vital sectors in analytics, face pressing concerns regarding environmental impact and safety, particularly in urban areas with growing populations and vehicle numbers. As solutions are sought, emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, notably Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), are being recognized for their potential in addressing these challenges effectively. Bird strikes, defined as collisions between birds and aircraft, pose significant safety risks, often causing damage to aircraft structures and engine failures, with potentially fatal consequences. These strikes are most likely during take-off, initial climb, approach, and landing phases due to the higher presence of birds at lower altitudes. The following document visually presents FAA-collected data on bird strikes from 2000 to 2011.

Significant financial costs incurred due to bird strikes, with some incidents exceeding $10 million.
Outliers with extremely high costs suggest catastrophic impacts on the aviation industry.
3.	Impact on Flights:
Majority of bird strikes have no significant impact on flights, but some result in aborted take-offs, precautionary landings, or engine shutdowns.
Approach phase has the highest frequency of bird strikes, with landing roll and take-off run phases also affected.
4.	Factors Affecting Strikes:
Altitude, time of day, and weather conditions influence the likelihood of bird strikes.
Pilots warned of bird activity have fewer instances of aborted take-offs or engine shutdowns.
5.	Strategies Based on Goals:
Implement wildlife management programs and enhance pilot warnings to mitigate bird strike risks.
Focus on identifying and monitoring specific bird species known to cause high costs and severe flight impacts.
