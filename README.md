# EDA-and-data-visualization-of-Bird-Strikes-between-2000-2011

Transport and communication, vital sectors in analytics, face pressing concerns regarding environmental impact and safety, particularly in urban areas with growing populations and vehicle numbers. As solutions are sought, emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, notably Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), are being recognized for their potential in addressing these challenges effectively. Bird strikes, defined as collisions between birds and aircraft, pose significant safety risks, often causing damage to aircraft structures and engine failures, with potentially fatal consequences. These strikes are most likely during take-off, initial climb, approach, and landing phases due to the higher presence of birds at lower altitudes. The following document visually presents FAA-collected data on bird strikes from 2000 to 2011.

Expected Outcomes :- 
1.  Trends Over Time:
    Identification of trends in bird strikes over the years, including any increase or decrease in frequency.
    Analysis of seasonal variations in bird strikes.
2.  Cost Implications:
    Assessment of the total cost incurred due to bird strikes over the years.
    Understanding the financial impact of bird strikes on airlines and aviation industry stakeholders.
3.  Impact on Flights:
    Evaluation of the effect of bird strikes on flight operations, including delays, diversions, and cancellations.
    Analysis of the severity of incidents, including injuries to passengers and damage to aircraft.
4.  Factors Influencing Strikes:
    Identification of factors such as altitude, time of day, and geographical location that influence the likelihood of bird strikes.
    Assessment of the effectiveness of prior warnings in mitigating the impact of bird strikes.
5.  Preventive Measures:
    Insights into the effectiveness of measures such as wildlife management programs and pilot warnings in reducing bird strike incidents.


Targeted Variables :- 

•	Date and Time: 
    Recording when the bird strike occurred, including the specific date and time of day.
•	Location: 
    Identifying where the bird strike incident took place, including the airport code or geographical coordinates.
•	Flight Information: 
    Capturing details about the flight involved, such as the airline, flight number, and aircraft type.
•	Bird Species: 
    Documenting the species of bird involved in the strike, if identifiable.
•	Flight Phase: 
    Categorizing the phase of flight during which the strike occurred, such as takeoff, landing, or cruise.
•	Altitude: 
    Noting the altitude of the aircraft at the time of the bird strike.
•	Weather Conditions: 
    Describing the weather conditions prevailing at the time of the incident, including factors like visibility, wind speed, and precipitation.
•	Damage Assessment: 
    Assessing the extent of damage to the aircraft resulting from the bird strike.
•	Cost: 
    Estimating the financial cost associated with the incident, including repair costs and operational impacts.
•	Injuries or Fatalities: 
    Recording any injuries to passengers or crew and any fatalities resulting from the bird strike.
